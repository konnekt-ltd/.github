# Hello, from Konnekt üëã
Nice to meet you! This is our GitHub page where we manage stuff like our public front-end (the website) and the private back-end (servers). I'm trying to keep this short and simple, but if you'd like to collaborate, you can e-mail (support@konnekt.chat) us any time and get a response, usually in 24-48 hours. Anyways, have a great day! ‚ù§

## Data privacy üîí
Some of you may be concerned with how Konnekt handles your data. Here's what we do with it:
- Personal/private information (password, e-mail, phone number, etc.) is encrypted
- Nothing is ever sold to a third-party (in compliance with GDPR)
- No one can view encrypted data, not even Konnekt employees
- You can request your public account data at any time

For a full list of data privacy practices, [you can view our Privacy Policy](https://konnekt.chat/privacy). Still got questions? You can shoot us an e-mail (support@konnekt.chat) and we'll respond in a reasonable time frame. Hope this helps!

## Why use Konnekt? ü§î
Konnekt is built to be a platform of free speech. We put it up to server owners to make their own rules and enforce them. The only thing we prohibit happening on our platform (by United States law) is any material that depicts a minor being sexually exploited. The rest is up to you.

### How are you going to stop scams?
Because Konnekt is very loose on what you can do, that comes with some drawbacks. For example, you could be DM'd at any random time by someone asking you to download an executable. To help solve this problem, Konnekt flags accounts that have attempted to cyberattack other individuals and gives you a last chance before starting a DM with them.

### Why don't you ban scammers?
As said before, Konnekt is focused around free-speech. In our rules, we have nothing that says you can't scam people. As such, we are unable to do anything. We can, however, help out with account recovery if you have the necessary information to prove to us that the account is yours.

To attempt at limiting the amount of people having their accounts stolen, we've implemented a system that flags people for malicious activities based off of **your** reports. A warning sign will be displayed on the bad actor's profile and an alert will appear when attempting to directly message them for the first time.
